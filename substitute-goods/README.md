# Substitute Goods

This data set is here to record how much I'm paying for substitute goods -- this
includes groceries, household items, and other such consumable goods. By
updating this data as I go, I plan to:

- Internalize the inherent cost of a given item.
- Identify trends in pricing as well as my ability to get a good deal.
